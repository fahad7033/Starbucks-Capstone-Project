## Building a Model
I built a rendomforest classifier to classify an offer wether it will sucsses with a specific customer or not. The model was trained and tested on 66501 instances (80% of the data used for training and 20% of the data used for testing). The model was evaluated in different matrices as followig:

Accuracy of the model on training data:  0.999962406015  <br>
Accuracy of the model on testing data:  0.916773174949

<br>
F1 score on training data:  0.999960197421   <br>
F1 score on testing data:  0.912538516236
